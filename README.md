Diabetes Milletus Prediction
Our project aims to predict if an individual is suffering from diabetes or not using random forests classifier in Machine Learning.
It takes inputs from the user and predicts if the individual is suffering from diabetes or not. 
The programming is done in python and the GUI uses Flask application.
If the individual is predicted to have diabetes, a piece of advice is given to keep it in control. Otherwise, some mandatory precautions that are to be taken to keep oneself away from diabetes are suggested.
